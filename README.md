# soundtrack

This application is a simple spotify clone I made while taking Bloc's part-time web developer course. It has limited real-world application as it doesn't use a database to store songs or their text-based information. However, that would be a fun building exercise for a newer back end developer. Feel free to clone and mess about with it as you choose!

Best Wishes,
